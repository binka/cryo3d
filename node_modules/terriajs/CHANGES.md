Change Log
==========

### 1.0.54

* Fixed a bug in `AbsIttCatalogItem` that caused no legend to be displayed.

### 1.0.53

* Improved compatibility with Internet Explorer 9.
* Made `CswCatalogGroup` able to find geospatial datasets on more CSW servers.
* Allow WMS parameters to be specified in json in uppercase (eg. STYLES).

### 1.0.52

* Added `MapBoxMapCatalogItem`, which is especially useful for base maps. A valid access token must be provided.
* Added a `getContainer()` method to Terria's `currentViewer`.
* Dramatically improved the performance of region mapping.
* Introduced new quantisation (color binning) methods to dramatically improve the display of choropleths (numerical quantities displayed as colors) for CSV files, instead of always using linear. Four values for `colorBinMethod` are supported:
  * "auto" (default), usually means "ckmeans"
  * "ckmeans": use "CK means" method, an improved version of Jenks Even Breaks to form clusters of values that are as distinct as possible. 
  * "quantile": use quantiles, evenly distributing values between bins
  * "none": use the previous linear color mapping method.
* The default style for CSV files is now 7 color bins with CK means method.
* Added support for color palettes from Color Brewer (colorbrewer2.org). Within `tableStyle`, use a value like `"colorPalette": "10-class BrBG"`.
* Improved the display of legends for CSV files, accordingly.
* URLs for legends are now encapsulated in a `LegendUrl` model, which accepts a mime type that will affect how the
  legend is rendered in the sidebar.
* Added support for the Socrata "new backend" with GeoJSON download to `SocrataCatalogGroup`.
* Moved URL config parameters to config.json, with sensible defaults. Specifically:
  *   regionMappingDefinitionsUrl: 'data/regionMapping.json',
  *   conversionServiceBaseUrl: '/convert/',
  *   proj4ServiceBaseUrl: '/proj4/',
  *   corsProxyBaseUrl: '/proxy/'
* Deprecated terria.regionMappingDefinitionsUrl (set it in config.json or leave it as default).

### 1.0.51

* Fixed a typo that prevented clearing the search query
* Added support for Nominatim search API hosted by OpenStreetMap (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim) with `NominatimSearchProviderViewModel`. This works by merging to 2 queries : one with the bounding parameter for the nearest results, and the other without the bounding parameter. The `countryCodes` property can be set to limit the result to a set of specific countries.
* Added `MapProgressBarViewModel`.  When added to the user interface with `MapProgressBarViewModel.create`, it shows a bar at the top of the map window indicating tile load progress.
* We no longer show the entity's ID (which is usually a meaningless GUID) on the feature info panel when the feature does not have a name.  Instead, we leave the area blank.
* Fixed a bug with time-dynamic imagery layers that caused features to be picked from the next time to be displayed, in addition to the current one.
* Replace `.` and `#` with `_` in property names meant to be used with `featureInfoTemplate`, so that these properties can be accessed by the [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) templating engine.
* Added support for time-varying properties (e.g. from a CZML file) on the feature info panel.
* `Cesium.zoomTo` now takes the terrain height into account when zooming to a rectangle.

### 1.0.50

* Put a white background behind legend images to fix legend images with transparent background being nearly invisible.
* Search entries are no longer duplicated for catalog items that appear in multiple places in the Data Catalogue
* Fixed the layer order changing in Cesium when a CSV variable is chosen.
* Layer name is now shown in the catalog item info panel for ESRI ArcGIS MapServer layers.
* Retrieve WFS or WCS URL associated with WMS data sources using DescribeLayer if no dataUrl is present.
* Downgrade Leaflet to 0.7.3 to fix specific feature clicking problems with 2D maps.
* Use `PolylineGraphics` instead of `PolygonGraphics` for unfilled polygons with an outline width greater than 1.  This works around the fact that Cesium does not support polygons with outline width great than 1 on Windows due to a WebGL limitation.
* Sorted ABS age variables numerically, not alphabetically.
* Removed extra space at the bottom of base map buttons.
* Share links now remember the currently active tab in the `ExplorerPanelViewModel`.
* Fixed a bug that prevented region mapping from working over HTTPS.
* The proxy is now used to avoid a mixed content warning when accessing an HTTP dataset from an HTTPS deployment of TerriaJS.
* Added `CameraView.fromLookAt` and `CameraView.fromPositionHeadingPitchRoll` functions.  These functions can be used to position the camera in new ways.

### 1.0.49

* Fixed a bug that caused poor performance when clicking a point on the map with lots of features and then closing the feature information panel.
* Apply linkify, instead of markdown, to properties shown in the Feature Info Panel.
* Fixed a bug that prevented feature scaling by value.
* Fixed a bug that prevented the csv `displayDuration` from working.
* Fixed a bug that ignored which column of the csv file to show as the legend initially.
* `NowViewingTabViewModel` is now composed of a number of sections.  Each section is given the opportunity to determine whether it applies to each catalog item.  Custom sections may be added by adding them to NowViewingTabViewModel.sections`.
* `CsvCatalogItem` and `AbsIttCatalogItem` now expose a `concepts` property that can be used to adjust the display.
* Added `Terria.cesiumBaseUrl` property.
* The user interface container DOM element may now be provided to `TerriaViewer` by specifying `uiContainer` in its options.  Previously it always used an element named `ui`.
* Legend URLs are now accessed via the proxy, if applicable.
* Fixed a bug that prevented feature scaling by value.
* Added support for [Urthecast](https://www.urthecast.com/) with `UrthecastCatalogGroup`.
* Fixed a bug that caused a `TypeError` on load when the share URL included enabled datasets with an order different from their order in the catalog.
* Improved the message that is shown to the user when their browser supports WebGL but it has a "major performance caveat".
* Fixed a bug that could cause an exception in some browsers (Internet Explorer, Safari) when loading a GeoJSON with embedded styles.
* Fixed a bug with Leaflet 2D map where clicks on animation controls or timeline would also register on the map underneath causing undesired feature selection and, when double clicked, zooming (also removed an old hack that disabled dragging while using the timeline slider)
* Changed Australian Topography base map server and updated the associated thumbnail.
* Added `updateApplicationOnMessageFromParentWindow` function.  After an app calls this function at startup, TerriaJS can be controlled by its parent window when embedded in an `iframe` by messages sent with `window.postMessage`.

### 1.0.48

* Added the ability to disable feature picking for `ArcGisMapServerCatalogItem`.
* Disabled feature picking for the Australian Topography and Australian Hydrography base layers created by `createAustraliaBaseMapOptions`.

### 1.0.47

* Make it possible to disable CSV region mapping warnings with the `showWarnings` init parameter.
* The `name` of a feature from a CSV file is now taken from a `name` or `title` column, if it exists.  Previously the name was always "Site Data".
* Fixed a bug that caused time-dynamic WMS layers with just one time to not be displayed.
* Underscores are now replaced with spaces in the feature info panel for `GeoJsonCatalogItem`.
* Added Proj4 projections to the location bar. Clicking on the bar switches between lats/longs and projected coordinates. To enable this, set `useProjection` to `true`
* Show information for all WMS features when a location is clicked.
* Fixed a bug that caused an exception when running inside an `<iframe>` and the user's browser blocked 3rd-party cookies.
* HTML and Markdown text in catalog item metadata, feature information, etc. is now formatted in a more typical way.  For example, text inside `<h1>` now looks like a heading.  Previously, most HTML styling was stripped out.
* Supports FeatureInfoTemplates on all catalog item types (previously only available on ImageryLayers).
* Apply markdown to properties shown in the Feature Info Panel.
* Add `includeCzml` option to CkanCatalogGroup.
* Fixed a bug that caused `WebMapServiceCatalogItem` to incorrectly populate the catalog item's metadata with data from GetCapabilities when another layer had a `Title` with the same value as the expected layer's `Name`.
* Update the default Australian topography basemap to Geoscience Australia's new worldwide layer (http://www.ga.gov.au/gisimg/rest/services/topography/National_Map_Colour_Basemap/MapServer)
* Allow color maps in CSV catalog items to be expressed as strings: colorMapString: "red-white-blue".
* Updated to [Cesium](http://cesiumjs.org) 1.15.  Significant changes relevant to TerriaJS users include:
  * Added support for the [glTF 1.0](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/specification/README.md) draft specification.
  * Added support for the glTF extensions [KHR_binary_glTF](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/Khronos/KHR_binary_glTF) and [KHR_materials_common](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/KHR_materials_common/extensions/Khronos/KHR_materials_common).
  * `ImageryLayerFeatureInfo` now has an `imageryLayer` property, indicating the layer that contains the feature.
  * Make KML invalid coordinate processing match Google Earth behavior. [#3124](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/3124)

### 1.0.46

* Fixed an incorrect require (`URIjs` instead of `urijs`).

### 1.0.45

* Major refactor of `CsvCatalogItem`, splitting region-mapping functionality out into `RegionProvider` and `RegionProviderList`. Dozens of new test cases. In the process, fixed a number of bugs and added new features including:
  * Regions can be matched using regular expressions, enabling matching of messy fields like local government names ("Baw Baw", "Baw Baw Shire", "Baw Baw (S)", "Shire of Baw Baw" etc).
  * Regions can be matched using a second field for disambiguation (eg, "Campbelltown" + "SA")
  * Drag-and-dropped datasets with a time column behave much better: rather than a fixed time being allocated to each row, each row occupies all the time up until the next row is shown.
  * Enumerated fields are colour coded in lat-long files, consist with region-mapped files.
  * Feedback is now provided after region mapping, showing which regions failed to match, and which matched more than once.
  * Bug: Fields with names starting with 'lon', 'lat' etc were too aggressively matched.
  * Bug: Numeric codes beginning with zeros (eg, certain NT 08xx postcodes) were treated as numbers and failed to match.
  * Bug: Fields with names that could be interpreted as regions weren't available as data variables.
* Avoid mixed content warnings when using the CartoDB basemaps.
* Allow Composite catalog items
* Handle WMS time interval specifications (time/time and time/time/periodicity)
* Moved `url` property to base CatalogItem base class.  Previously it was defined separately on most derived catalog items.
* Most catalog items now automatically expose a `dataUrl` that is the same as their `url`.
* Added custom definable controls to `CatalogMember`s.
  * To define a control, subclass `CatalogMemberControl` and register the control in `ViewModels/registerCatalogMemberControl` with a unique control name, control class and required property name.
  * If a `CatalogMember` has a property with the required property name either directly on the member or in its `customProperties` object, the control will appear in the catalog with the member and will fire the `activate` function when clicked.
  * Controls can be registered to appear on both the left and right side using `registerLeftSideControl` and `registerRightSideControl` respectively.
  * An example can be seen in the `CatalogMemberDownloadControl`
  * Currently top level members do not show controls.
* The `LocationBarViewModel` now shows the latitude and longitude coordinates of the mouse cursor in 2D as well as 3D.
* The `LocationBarViewModel` no longer displays a misleading elevation of 0m when in "3D Smooth" mode.
* Added `@menu-bar-right-offset` LESS parameter to control the right position of the menu bar.
* Added `forceProxy` flag to all catalog members to indicate that an individual item should use the proxy regardless of whether the domain is in the list of domains to proxy.
* Allow a single layer of an ArcGIS MapServer to be added through the "Add Data" interface.
* Added `WfsFeaturesCatalogGroup`.  This group is populated with a catalog item for each feature queried from a WFS server.
* The Feature Info panel now shows all selected features in an accordion control.  Previously it only showed the first one.
* Added `featureInfoTemplate` property to `CatalogItem`.  It is used to provide a custom Markdown or HTML template to display when a feature in the catalog item is clicked.  The template is parameterized on the properties of the feature.
* Updated to [Cesium](http://cesiumjs.org) 1.14.  Significant changes relevant to TerriaJS users include:
  * Fixed issues causing the terrain and sky to disappear when the camera is near the surface. [#2415](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/2415) and [#2271](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/2271)
  * Fixed issues causing the terrain and sky to disappear when the camera is near the surface. [#2415](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/2415) and [#2271](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/2271)
  * Provided a workaround for Safari 9 where WebGL constants can't be accessed through `WebGLRenderingContext`. Now constants are hard-coded in `WebGLConstants`. [#2989](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/2989)
  * Added a workaround for Chrome 45, where the first character in a label with a small font size would not appear. [#3011](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/3011)
  * Fixed an issue with drill picking at low frame rates that would cause a crash. [#3010](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/3010)

### 1.0.44

* Fixed a bug that could cause timeseries animation to "jump" when resuming play after it was paused.
* Make it possible for catalog item initialMessage to require confirmation, and to be shown every time.
* When catalog items are enabled, the checkbox now animates to indicate that loading is in progress.
* Add `mode=preview` option in the hash portion of the URL.  When present, it is assumed that TerriaJS is being used as a previewer and the "small screen warning" will not be shown.
* Added `maximumLeafletZoomLevel` constructor option to `TerriaViewer`, which can be used to force Leaflet to allow zooming closer than its default of level 18.
* Added the `attribution` property to catalog items.  The attribution is displayed on the map when the catalog item is enabled.
* Remove an unnecessary instance of the Cesium InfoBox class when viewing in 2D
* Fixed a bug that prevented `AbsIttCatalogGroup` from successfully loading its list of catalog items.
* Allow missing URLs on embedded data (eg. embedded czml data)
* Fixed a bug loading URLs for ArcGIS services names that start with a number.
* Updated to [Cesium](http://cesiumjs.org) 1.13.  Significant changes relevant to TerriaJS users include:
  * The default `CTRL + Left Click Drag` mouse behavior is now duplicated for `CTRL + Right Click Drag` for better compatibility with Firefox on Mac OS [#2913](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/2913).
  * Fixed an issue where non-feature nodes prevented KML documents from loading. [#2945](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/2945)

### 1.0.43

* Fixed a bug that prevent the opened/closed state of groups from being preserved when sharing.

### 1.0.42

* Added a `cacheDuration` property to all catalog items.  The new property is used to specify, using Varnish-like notation (e.g. '1d', '10000s') the default length of time to cache URLs related to the catalog item.
* Fix bug when generating share URLs containing CSV items.
* Improve wording about downloading data from non-GeoJSON-supporting WFS servers.

### 1.0.41

* Improvements to `AbsIttCatalogItem` caching from the Tools menu.

### 1.0.40

* `ArcGisMapServerCatalogItem` now shows "NoData" tiles by default even after showing the popup message saying that max zoom is exceeded.  This can be disabled by setting its `showTilesAfterMessage` property to false.

### 1.0.39

* Fixed a race condition in `AbsIttCatalogItem` that could cause the legend and map to show different state than the Now Viewing UI suggested.
* Fixed a bug where an ABS concept with a comma in its name (e.g. "South Eastern Europe,nfd(c)" in Country of Birth) would cause values for concept that follow to be misappropriated to the wrong concepts.

### 1.0.38

* `AbsIttCatalogItem` now allows the region type to be set on demand rather than only at load time.
* `CsvCatalogItem` can now have no display variable selected, in which case all points are the same color.

### 1.0.37

* Added `CswCatalogGroup` for populating a catalog by querying an OGC CSW service.
* Added `CatalogMember.infoSectionOrder` property, to allow the order of info sections to be configured per catalog item when necessary.
* Fixed a bug that prevented WMTS layers with a single `TileMatrixSetLink` from working correctly.
* Added support for WMTS layers that can only provide tiles in JPEG format.
* Fixed testing and caching of ArcGis layers from tools and added More information option for imagery layers.
* TerriaJS no longer requires Google Analytics.  If a global `ga` function exists, it is used just as before.  Otherwise, events are, by default, logged to the console.
* The default event analytics behavior can be specified by passing an instance of `ConsoleAnalytics` or `GoogleAnalytics` to the `Terria` constructor.  The API key to use with `GoogleAnalytics` can be specified explicitly to its constructor, or it can be specified in the `parameter.googleAnalyticsKey` property in `config.json`.
* Made polygons drastically faster in 2D.
* TerriaJS now shortens share URLs by default when a URL shortener is available.
* Added Google Analytics reporting of the application URL.  This is useful for tracking use of share URLs.
* Added the ability to specify a specific dynamic layer of an ArcGIS Server using just a URL.

### 1.0.36

* Calculate extent of TopoJSON files so that the viewer correctly pans+zooms when a TopoJSON file is loaded.
* Fixed a bug that caused the `Terria#clock` to keep ticking (and therefore using CPU / battery) once started even after selecting a non-time-dynamic dataset.
* Fixed a bug that caused the popup message to appear twice when a dataset failed to load.
* Added layer information to the Info popup for WMS datasets.
* Added ability to filter catalog search results by:
  * type: `is:wms`, `-is:esri-mapserver`. A result must match any 'is:' and no '-is:'.
  * url: `url:vic.gov.au`, `-url:nicta.com.au`. A result must match any 'url:', and no '-url:'.
* Added ability to control the number of catalog search results: `show:20`, `show:all`

### 1.0.35

* Polygons from GeoJSON datasets are now filled.
* Left-aligned feature info table column and added some space between columns.
* Added `EarthGravityModel1996`.
* Extended `LocationBarViewModel` to show heights relative to a geoid / mean sea level model.  By default, EGM96 is used.
* Added support for styling GeoJSON files, either in catalog (add .style{} object) or embedded directly in the file following the [SimpleStyle spec](https://github.com/mapbox/simplestyle-spec).
* Fixed a bug that caused the 3D view to use significant CPU time even when idle.
* Added CartoDB's Positron and Dark Matter base maps to `createGlobalBaseMapOptions`.
* Added support for subdomains to `OpenStreetMapCatalogItem`.

### 1.0.34

* Fixed a bug that prevented catalog items inside groups on the Search tab from being enabled.
* Added `PopupMessageConfirmationViewModel`. It prevents the Popup from being closed unless the confirm button is pressed. Can also optionally have a deny button with a custom action.
* Added support for discovering GeoJSON datasets from CKAN.
* Added support for zipped GeoJSON files.
* Made `KmlCatalogItem` use the proxy when required.
* Made `FeatureInfoPanelViewModel` use the white panel background in more cases.
* Significantly improved the experience on devices with small screens, such as phones.
* Fixed a bug that caused only the portion of a CKAN group name before the first comma to be used.

### 1.0.33

* Added the `legendUrls` property to allow a catalog item to optionally have multiple legend images.
* Added a popup message when zooming in to the "No Data" scales of an `ArcGisMapServerCatalogItem`.
* Added `CatalogGroup.sortFunction` property to allow custom sorting of catalog items within a group.
* Added `ImageryLayerCatalogItem.treat403AsError` property.
* Added a title text when hovering over the label of an enabled catalog item.  The title text informs the user that clicking will zoom to the item.
* Added `createBingBaseMapOptions` function.
* Added an option to `KnockoutMarkdownBinding` to optionally skip HTML sanitization and therefore to allow unsafe HTML.
* Upgraded to Cesium 1.11.
* `CatalogItem.zoomTo` can now zoom to much smaller bounding box rectangles.

### 1.0.32

* Fixed CKAN resource format matching for KML, CSV, and Esri REST.

### 1.0.31

* Added support for optionally generating shorter URLs when sharing by using the Google URL shortening service.

### 1.0.30

* `WebMapServiceCatalogItem` and `ArcGisMapServerCatalogItem` now augment directly-specified metadata with metadata queried from the server.
* "Data Details" and "Service Details" on the catalog item info panel are now collapsed by default.  This improves the performance of the panel and hides some overly technical details.
* `ArcGisMapServerCatalogItem.layers` can now specify layer names in addition to layer IDs.  Layer names are matched in a case-insensitive manner and only if a direct ID match is not found.
* `itemProperties` are now applied through the normal JSON loading mechanism, so properties that are represented differently in code and in JSON will now work as well.
* Added support for `csv-geo-*` (e.g. csv-geo-au) to `CkanCatalogGroup`.
* The format name used in CKAN can now be specified to `CkanCatalogGroup` using the `wmsResourceFormat`, `kmlResourceFormat`, `csvResourceFormat`, and `esriMapServerResourceFormat` properties.  These properties are all regular expressions.  When the format of a CKAN resource returned from `package_search` matches one of these regular expressions, it is treated as that type within TerriaJS.
* `CkanCatalogGroup` now fills the `dataUrl` property of created items by pointing to the dataset's page on CKAN.
* The catalog item information panel now displays `info` sections in a consistent order.  The order can be overridden by setting `CatalogItemInfoViewModel.infoSectionOrder`.
* An empty `description` or `info` section is no longer shown on the catalog item information panel.  This can be used to remove sections that would otherwise be populated from dataset metadata.

### 1.0.29

* Add support for loading init files via the proxy when necessary.
* Switched to using the updated URL for STK World Terrain, `//assets.agi.com/stk-terrain/v1/tilesets/world/tiles`.

### 1.0.28

* Fixed a bug that prevented links to non-image (e.g. ArcGIS Map Server) legends from appearing on the Now Viewing panel.

### 1.0.27

* Use terriajs-cesium 1.10.7, fixing a module load problem in really old browers like IE8.

### 1.0.25

* Fixed incorrect date formatting in the timeline and animation controls on Internet Explorer 9.
* Add support for CSV files with longitude and latitude columns but no numeric value column.  Such datasets are visualized as points with a default color and do not have a legend.
* The Feature Information popup is now automatically closed when the user changes the `AbsIttCatalogItem` filter.

### 1.0.24

* Deprecated:
  * Renamed `AusGlobeViewer` to `TerriaViewer`.  `AusGlobeViewer` will continue to work until 2.0 but using it will print a deprecation warning to the browser console.
  * `BrandBarViewModel.create` now takes a single `options` parameter.  The container element, which used to be specified as the first parameter, should now be specified as the `container` property of the `options` parameter.  The old function signature will continue to work until 2.0 but using it will print a deprecation warning to the browser console.
* `WebMapServiceCatalogItem` now determines its rectangle from the GetCapabilities metadata even when configured to use multiple WMS layers.
* Added the ability to specify the terrain URL or the `TerrainProvider` to use in the 3D view when constructing `TerriaViewer`.
* `AbsIttCatalogItem` styles can now be set using the `tableStyle` property, much like `CsvCatalogItem`.
* Improved `AbsIttCatalogItem`'s tolerance of errors from the server.
* `NavigationViewModel` can now be constructed with a list of `controls` to include, instead of the standard `ZoomInNavigationControl`, `ResetViewNavigationControl`, and `ZoomOutNavigationControl`.
* Fixed a bug that caused the brand bar to slide away with the explorer panel on Internet Explorer 9.

### 1.0.23

* Fixed a bug that prevented features from being pickable from ABS datasets on the 2D map.
* Fixed a bug that caused the Explorer Panel tabs to be missing or misaligned in Firefox.

### 1.0.22

* Changed to use JPEG instead of PNG format for the Natural Earth II basemap.  This makes the tile download substantially smaller.

### 1.0.21

* Added an `itemProperties` property to `AbsIttCatalogGroup`.
* Added a `nowViewingMessage` property to `CatalogItem`.  This message is shown by the `NowViewingAttentionGrabberViewModel` when the item is enabled.  Each unique message is shown only once.

### 1.0.20

* Added the ability to specify SVG icons on Explorer Panel tabs.
* Added an icon to the Search tab.
* Added support for accessing Australian Bureau of Statistics data via the ABS-ITT API, using `AbsIttCatalogGroup` and `AbsIttCatalogItem`.
* The Now Viewing panel now contains controls for selecting which column to show in CSV datasets.

### 1.0.19

* Added `NowViewingAttentionGrabberViewModel`.  It calls attention the Now Viewing tab the first time a catalog item is enabled.
* Added `isHidden` property to catalog items and groups.  Hidden items and groups do not show up in the catalog or in search results.

### 1.0.18

* Added `featureInfoFields` property to `CsvCatalogItem.tableStyle`.  It allows setting which fields to show in the Feature Info popup, and the name to use for each.
* Added `OpenStreetMapCatalogItem` for connecting to tile servers using the OpenStreetMap tiling scheme.
* Added `CkanCatalogGroup.allowEntireWmsServers` property.  When set and the group discovers a WMS resource without a layer parameter, it adds a catalog item for the entire server instead of ignoring the resource.
* Added `WebMapTileServiceCatalogGroup` and `WebMapTileServiceCatalogItem` for accessing WMTS servers.
* Handle the case of an `ArcGisMapServerCatalogItem` with an advertised extent that is outside the valid range.
* We now pass ArcGIS MapServer metadata, when it's available, through to Cesium's `ArcGisMapServerImageryProvider` so that it doesn't need to re-request the metadata.
* Changed the style of the Menu Bar to have visually-separate menu items.
* Added support for SVG menu item icons to `MenuBarViewModel`.
* Improved popup message box sizing.

### 1.0.17

* Upgraded to TerriajS Cesium 1.10.2.
* Added `ImageryLayerCatalogItem.isRequiredForRendering`.  This is set to false by default and to true for base maps.  Slow datasets with `isRequiredForRendering=false` are less likely to prevent other datasets from appearing in the 3D view.
* The "Dataset Testing" functionality (on the hidden Tools menu accessible by adding `#tools=1` to the URL) now gives up tile requests and considers them failed after two seconds.  It also outputs some JSON that can be used as the `blacklist` property to blacklist all of the datasets that timed out.
* Added a feature to count the total number of datasets from the hidden Tools menu.
* Fixed a bug that caused the 2D / 3D buttons the Maps menu to get out of sync with the actual state of the map after switching automatically to 2D due to a performance problem.

### 1.0.16

* Deprecated:
  * `ArcGisMapServerCatalogGroup` has been deprecated.  Please use `ArcGisCatalogGroup` instead.
* Replaced Cesium animation controller with TerriaJS animation controller.
* Replaced Cesium Viewer widget with the CesiumWidget when running Cesium.
* Added the ability to turn a complete ArcGIS Server, or individual folders within it, into a catalog group using `ArcGisCatalogGroup`.

### 1.0.15

* Fix imagery attribution on the 2D map.

### 1.0.14

* Fixed share URL generation when the application is not running at the root directory of its web server.
* Fixed a bug that caused Internet Explorer 8 users to see a blank page instead of a message saying their browser is incompatible.

### 1.0.13

* Breaking changes:
  * Added a required `@brand-bar-height` property.
* `ExplorerPanelViewModel` can now be created with `isOpen` initially set to false.
* TerriaJS now raises an error and hides the dataset when asked to show an `ImageryLayerCatalogItem` in Leaflet and that catalog item does not use the Web Mercator (EPSG:3857) projection.  Previously, the dataset would silently fail to display.
* Improved error handling in `CzmlCatalogItem`, `GeoJsonCatalogItem`, and `KmlCatalogItem`.
* Made the `clipToRectangle` property available on all `ImageryProvider`-based catalog items, not just `WebMapServiceCatalogItem`.
* Added `CatalogMember.isPromoted` property.  Promoted catalog groups and items are displayed above non-promoted groups and items.
* Add support for ArcGIS MapServer "Raster Layers" in addition to "Feature Layers".

### 1.0.12

* Allow Esri ArcGIS MapServers to be added via the "Add Data" panel.
* Adds `baseMapName` and `viewerMode` fields to init files and share links. `baseMapName` is any base map name in the map settings panel and `viewerMode` can be set to `'2d'` or `'3d'`.
* Added `tableStyle.legendTicks` property to `CsvCatalogItem`.  When specified, the generated legend will have the specified number of equally-spaced lines with labels in its legend.

### 1.0.11

* Fixed a bug that prevented HTML feature information from showing up with a white background in Internet Explorer 9 and 10.
* Fixed a bug that prevented WMS GetCapabilities properties, such as CRS, from being properly inherited from the root layer.
* Tweaked credit / attribution styling.

### 1.0.10

* Added support for a developer attribution on the map.
* Fixed a bug that could cause results from previous async catalog searches to appear in the search results.

### 1.0.9

* Show Cesium `ImageryProvider` tile credits / attribution in Leaflet when using `CesiumTileLayer`.

### 1.0.8

* `WebMapServiceCatalogGroup` now populates the catalog using the hierarchy of layers returned by the WMS server in GetCapabilities.  To keep the previous behavior, set the `flatten` property to true.
* Potentially breaking changes:
  * The `getFeatureInfoAsGeoJson` and `getFeatureInfoAsXml` properties have been removed.  Use `getFeatureInfoFormats` instead.
* Added support for text/html responses from WMS GetFeatureInfo.
* Make the `FeatureInfoPanelViewModel` use a white background when displaying a complete HTML document.
* `KnockoutMarkdownBinding` no longer tries to interpret complete HTML documents (i.e. those that contain an <html> tag) as Markdown.
* The feature info popup for points loaded from CSV files now shows numeric columns with a missing value as blank instead of as 1e-34.
* `ArcGisMapServerCatalogItem` now offers metadata, used to populate the Data Details and Service Details sections of the catalog item info panel.
* `ArcGisMapServerCatalogGroup` now populates a "Service Description" and a "Data Description" info section for each catalog item from the MapServer's metadata.
* The `metadataUrl` is now populated (and shown) from the regular MapServer URL.
* Added 'keepOnTop' flag support for imageryLayers in init file to allow a layer to serve as a mask.
* Added 'keepOnTop' support to region mapping to allow arbitrary masks based on supported regions.
* Checkboxes in the Data Catalogue and Search tabs now have a larger clickable area.

### 1.0.7

* `CatalogItemNameSearchProviderViewModel` now asynchronously loads groups so items in unloaded groups can be found, too.
* Do not automatically fly to the first location when pressing Enter in the Search input box.
* Changed `ArcGisMapServerCatalogItem` to interpret a `maxScale` of 0 from an ArcGIS MapServer as "not specified".
* Added an `itemProperties` property to `ArcGisMapServerCatalogGroup`, allowing properties of auto-discovered layers to be specified explicitly.
* Added `validDropElements`, `validDropClasses`, `invalidDropElements`, and `invalidDropClasses` properties to `DragDropViewModel` for finer control over where dropping is allowed.
* Arbitrary parameters can now be specified in `config.json` by adding them to the `parameters` property.


### 1.0.6

* Added support for region mapping based on region names instead of region numbers (example in `public/test/countries.csv`).
* Added support for time-dynamic region mapping (example in `public/test/droughts.csv`).
* Added the ability to specify CSV styling in the init file (example in `public/init/test.json`).
* Improved the appearance of the legends generated with region mapping.
* Added the ability to region-map countries (example in `public/test/countries.csv`).
* Elminated distracting "jumping" of the selection indicator when picking point features while zoomed in very close to the surface.
* Fixed a bug that caused features to be picked from all layers in an Esri MapServer, instead of just the visible ones.
* Added support for the WMS MinScaleDenominator property and the Esri MapServer maxScale property, preventing layers from disappearing when zoomed in to close to the surface.
* Polygons loaded from KML files are now placed on the terrain surface.
* The 3D viewer now shows Bing Maps imagery unmodified, matching the 2D viewer.  Previously, it applied a gamma correction.
* All catalog items now have an `info` property that allows arbitrary sections to be shown for the item in the info popup.
* `CkanCatalogGroup` now has a `groupBy` property to control whether catalog items are grouped by CKAN group ("group"), CKAN organization ("organization"), or not grouped at all ("none").
* `CkanCatalogGroup` now has a `useResourceName` property to control whether the name of the catalog item is derived from the resource (true), or the dataset itself (false).
* The catalog item info page now renders a much more complete set of Markdown and HTML elements.
